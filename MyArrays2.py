Many calculation methods can be performed on specific array dimensions,
known as the array’s axes. These methods receive an axis keyword argument
that specifies which dimension to use in the calculation, giving you a
quick way to perform calculations by row or column in a two-dimensional array.'''

grades.mean(axis=0)

# So 95.25 above is the average of the first column’s grades (87, 100, 94 and 100)

# within each individual row. To calculate each student’s average grade for
# all exams, we can use:

'''NumPy offers dozens of standalone universal functions (or ufuncs) that perform various element-wise operations.'''


#Let’s create an array and calculate the square root of its values, using the sqrt universal function:

numbers = np.array([1,4,9,16,25,36])

np.sqrt(numbers)


# Let’s add two arrays with the same shape, using the add universal function:

numbers2 = np.arange(1, 7) * 10

np.add(numbers, numbers2)



# Let’s use the multiply universal function to multiply every element of numbers2 by the scalar value 5:

np.multiply(numbers2, 5)


# Let’s reshape numbers2 into a 2-by-3 array, then multiply its values by a one-dimensional array of three elements:

numbers3 = numbers2.reshape(2, 3)

numbers4 = np.array([2, 4, 6])

np.multiply(numbers3, numbers4)

''' This works because numbers4 has the same length as each row of numbers3, so NumPy can apply the multiply operation by
 treating numbers4 as if it were the following array:

[2, 4, 6]]    '''


# Indexing and Slicing

# To select an element in a two-dimensional array, specify a tuple containing the element’s row and column indices
# in square brackets (as in snippet [4]):

grades = np.array([[87, 96, 70], [100, 87, 90],
                   [94, 77, 90], [100, 81, 82]])


grades[0, 1] # row 0, column 1
#96


# To select a single row, specify only one index in square brackets:
grades[1]
#array([100,  87,  90])


# To select multiple sequential rows, use slice notation (remember upper limit is not included):
grades[0:2]
#array([[ 87,  96,  70],
#       [100,  87,  90]])


# To select multiple non-sequential rows, use a list of row indices:
grades[[1, 3]]
#array([[100,  87,  90],
#       [100,  81,  82]])


# You can select subsets of the columns by providing a tuple specifying the row(s) and column(s) to select.
# Each can be a specific index, a slice or a list. Let’s select only the elements in the first column:

grades[:, 0]

# The 0 after the comma indicates that we’re selecting only column 0.

# The : before the comma indicates which rows within that column to select. In this case, : is a slice representing all rows.


# You can select consecutive columns using a slice:

grades[:, 1:3]
